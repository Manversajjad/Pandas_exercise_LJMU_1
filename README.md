Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D) to handle diverse data types and formats efficiently. Pandas is widely used for data cleaning, transformation, exploration, and visualization. Its functions simplify operations such as filtering, aggregating, merging datasets, handling missing values, and reshaping data. Ideal for data science, finance, and statistics, Pandas integrates seamlessly with other libraries, making it essential for Python-based data analysis tasks.
